# Plantilla

A simple tool to apply a template for my social media, because twitter fkin sucks

## How to run
The project is built with vite and vanilla js made to work right on the browser
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Building for Arch Linux
Plantilla is built for Arch, using the system wide electron
To build it you may:
